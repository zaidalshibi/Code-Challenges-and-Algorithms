# Linkedlist:

## Challenge02 - Find Middle Node:

<div><p>Given the <code>head</code> of a singly linked list, return <em>the middle node of the linked list</em>.</p>

<p>If there are two middle nodes, return <strong>the second middle</strong> node.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="../../../assets/linked-list/ll-02-node1.jpg" style="width: 544px; height: 65px;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> head = [1,2,3,4,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> [3,4,5]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The middle node of the list is node 3.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="../../../assets/linked-list/ll-02-node2.jpg" style="width: 664px; height: 65px;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
<strong>Output:</strong> [4,5,6]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The number of nodes in the list is in the range <code>[1, 100]</code>.</li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 100</code></li>
</ul>



## Instruction:
